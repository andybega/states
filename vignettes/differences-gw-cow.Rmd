The COW and G&W state system lists generally have high overlap, but there are differences in states start and end dates, and also some differences in which numeric code is used for a particular states. Some notable code differences for post-WW2 states to look out for when trying to merge datasets with/from COW to G&W coding are:

| Case                                                | G&W          | COW          |
