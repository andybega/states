I've changed the description from: 

"Create and manage panel data consisting of independent states in the international system."

To:

"Create panel data consisting of independent states from 1816 to
    the present. The package includes the Gleditsch & Ward (G&W) and Correlates
    of War (COW) lists of independent states, as well as helper functions for 
    working with state panel data and standardizing other data sources to 
    create country-year/month/etc. data. "

Thanks!
